    <h1>What is a Good Title?</h1>
    <p>The title should describe the content and the meaning of the page.</p>
    <p>The page title is very important for search engine optimization (SEO). The text is used by search engine algorithms to decide the order when listing pages in search results.</p>
    <p>The title element:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>defines a title in the browser toolbar</li>
        <li>provides a title for the page when it is added to favorites</li>
        <li>displays a title for the page in search engine-results</li>

    </ul>
